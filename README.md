# bloodapp

While the name sounds scary the idea is to create a web-app that allows 2 entities:
1) Doner ( people are want to donate blood )
2) Recipient ( people who need blood )

Aim is to have a working app that lets both blood doners and recipient interact with each other and help each other out. 

But that's just a dream a the moment; working on this slowely.
